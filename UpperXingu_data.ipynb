    "\n",
    "In the first phase of our analysis, we focus on building a **comprehensive geospatial dataset** that captures the environmental, climatic, and topographic complexity of the Upper Xingu landscape. This includes variables extracted from diverse sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LiDAR-derived elevation and slope** (via OpenTopography)  \n",
    "- **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery** (NDVI, NDBI, BSI)  \n",
    "- **Soil characteristics** from ISRIC SoilGrids (SOC, pH, clay, CEC, bulk density)  \n",
    "- **19 bioclimatic variables** from WorldClim v2  \n",
    "- **Distance to major river systems** (from GSHHG)\n",
    "\n",
    "To our knowledge, this is the **first comprehensive integration** of such multimodal environmental features for archaeological modeling in the **Upper Xingu**, enabling high-resolution ecological characterization of both known and hypothetical sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key novelty of this phase is the use of **synthetic test sites**, generated by prompting **GPT-4** with cultural-geographic logic, terrain patterns, and known site attributes. This allowed us to simulate 50 plausible but previously undocumented candidate coordinates—serving as a **test set for inference** in downstream classification. These GPT-generated points mirror how ancient Xinguano communities may have situated their settlements, offering a powerful and reproducible approach to exploratory archaeology in underexplored forest regions.\n"

    "\n",
    "As part of our project goal to evaluate the likelihood of undiscovered archaeological sites in the Upper Xingu, we generated **50 synthetic test coordinates** to simulate novel candidates for model inference.\n",

    "We began by extracting a subset of known Upper Xingu sites from the open-access dataset provided by [Walker et al. (2022)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj9727), which contains over 2,000 georeferenced archaeological locations across Amazonia.\n",

    "> *\"I will upload 30 data points from the Upper Xingu region, sourced from a known archaeological dataset. Using your prior archaeological knowledge, patterns from past discoveries, and geographic settlement logic, generate 50 new coordinate points within the Upper Xingu that are likely to represent undiscovered ADE or earthwork sites. You may base your reasoning on proximity to previously documented ADEs and earthworks, environmental factors, or known cultural clustering theories.\"*\n",

    "\n",
    "After generating 50 synthetic test site coordinates using GPT-4, we implemented a second layer of reasoning to validate their plausibility and novelty. The purpose of this step was twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exclude locations with known archaeological documentation**, ensuring the test set only includes candidate sites that have not already been studied or published (e.g., via TerraBrasilis, research papers, or public databases).\n",
    "2. **Filter out sites compromised by modern land-use change**, such as deforested zones, active agriculture, or urban development, using GPT-assisted cross-checking based on satellite observations and known deforestation records (e.g., [TerraBrasilis](http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We prompted GPT-4 to reason through each of the 50 coordinates and return a qualitative assessment based on:\n",
    "- Proximity to known archaeological zones (excluding overlap)\n",
    "- Presence of intact forest or plausible pre-Columbian landscape\n",
    "- Absence from existing documentation in public archives or known field surveys\n",
